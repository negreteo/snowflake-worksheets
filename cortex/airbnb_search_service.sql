-- Create cortex search service
-- The ON parameter specifies the column for queries to search over. In this case, itâ€™s the listing_text, which is generated in the source query as a concatenation of several text columns in the base table.
-- The ATTRIBUTES parameter specifies the columns that you will be able to filter search results on. This example filers on room_type and amenities when issuing queries to the listing_text column.
-- The WAREHOUSE and TARGET_LAG parameters specify the user-provided warehouse and the desired freshness of the search service, respectively. This example specifies to use the cortex_search_tutorial_wh warehouse to create the index and perform refreshes, and to keep the service no more than '1 hour' behind the source table AIRBNB_LISTINGS.
-- The AS field defines the source table for the service. This example concatenates several text columns in the original table into the search column listing_text so that queries can search over multiple fields.
